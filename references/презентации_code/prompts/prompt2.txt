I'm working on a presentation for my diploma. I want you to help me create a visually stunning presentation using React, TypeScript and SCSS. You can use absolutely any other libraries that are necessary out there. You can find my current version of the presentation in `презентация___v008.pdf`. I already have some HTML code stored in @презентации_code folder. Now, the key point here since we're making this for BMSTU (Bauman Moscow State University) is the color blue. The presentation's background MUST be light (white mostly).

Basically, I want you to create a project in this root folder and remake this whole thing using React. For pages I was thinking React Router or actually anything to your liking. You can find an example of a similar project in @market_analysis_of_benchmarking_tools folder.
